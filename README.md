# Sorting12
Craig Austgen
Turned in: 3-23-15
Assignment: Chapter 12 for sorting code for CMP341 DSA
Ran with: d8 
File(s) to run: printData.js

How it works:
Most of the sorting algorithms are implemented in the arrayClass.js file except for qsort, that file is ran on it's own(using d8). To change which algorithm to use simplycomment out the one you wish you use.
